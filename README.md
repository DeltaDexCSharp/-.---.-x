ᴰ.ᴱᴸᵀᴬ Library & ᴰ.ᴱx Class [C#]
A collection of set functions and parameters intended to build .Net Applications.
The implemenation begins at Main() and allows the creation of a Windows Form Application & more every commit via dynamic functions, parameters and etc...

ᴰ.ᴱᴸᵀᴬ & ᴰ.ᴱx are intended to remove the need/use of the Form[Design] IDE and allows for a number based
control structure for building Forms and or Other .NET Applications. 

While the ᴰ.ᴱᴸᵀᴬ Library can be used without the ᴰ.ᴱx Class they are intended to be used together and some ᴰ.ᴱx functions rely on ᴰ.ᴱᴸᵀᴬ.

I'm a hobbyist so by all means I understand if some codes/methods are considered "Bad Practices".

If you like the idea and are looking to expand it by all means, take a go. 

Although I am currently expanding/creating the "core" of the project now, it will be available shortly.

I hope I've understood the terms/github layout as it's intended to be x'D

The current objective is to be able to choose a blank project simply import the ᴰ.ᴱᴸᵀᴬ Library & ᴰ.ᴱx Class and be set to build an
application via ᴰ.ᴱᴸᵀᴬ ᴰ.ᴱx.

This should currently be possible by I have a lot of coding planned that has yet to be coded.

The combo also allows for features such as a rounded borderless form and or control.
