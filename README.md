ᴰ.ᴱᴸᵀᴬ Library & ᴰ.ᴱx Class [C#]

Description:
A collection of set functions and parameters intended to build .Net Applications.
The implemenation begins at Main() and allows the creation of a Windows Form Application & more every commit via dynamic functions, parameters and etc...

ᴰ.ᴱᴸᵀᴬ & ᴰ.ᴱx are intended and purposed toward removing the use of the Form[Design] IDE and allows for a number & name based
control structure for building Forms and or Other .NET Applications. 

While the ᴰ.ᴱᴸᵀᴬ Library can be used without the ᴰ.ᴱx Class they are intended to be used together and some ᴰ.ᴱx functions rely on ᴰ.ᴱᴸᵀᴬ.

The current objective is to be able to download a startup project and be set to build an application via ᴰ.ᴱᴸᵀᴬ ᴰ.ᴱx.

I'm a hobbyist so by all means I understand if some code/methods are considered "Bad Practices".
If you like the idea and are looking to expand it by all means, take a go. 

Project github version on hold for major update/changes.

#1 Upcoming Update:

Controls will now have overload option to be called by name instead of control structure only.
Allowing shorter simpler calls to managing Controls.

The PROJECT FILES AND NOTES CURRENTLY AVAILAGBLE ARE OUTDATED FOR NOW. 

1 WEEK STARTUP PERIOD UNTIL NEXT POST UPDATE
